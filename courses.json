      "description": "When Oprah Winfrey founded a secondary school for girls in post-apartheid Johannesburg, she was following a long tradition of African American solidarity with the equally oppressed black population of South Africa. Forged in the 1780s by black north Atlantic mariners, the solidarity would encompass many areas of life before and during the apartheid era. This course explores four of those areas: evangelical ties connecting African American churches with South Africa\u2019s independent church organizations; the spread of Booker T. Washington\u2019s educational ideals in black South African academic circles; the impact of the Harlem Renaissance on African popular township culture; and the cross-fertilization of political ideologies originating on both sides of the Atlantic: Africans fighting against apartheid learned important lessons from the crusades of anti-colonial activists and internationalists in the diaspora, such as Marcus Garvey, Paul Robeson, and Mahatma Gandhi."

The powerful, multi-part relationships established by this trio of drums provide a rhythmic foundation for the ensemble, enabling djembe players to develop technique in executing both accompaniment and solo parts. Drawing upon his experience as a soloist with the internationally acclaimed groups Les Percussions de Guin\u00e9e and Les Ballets Africains, Fana engages ensemble players with a wide repertory of music from various regions of Guinea, including the rhythms of the Susu, Malinke, and Baga language groups."

Initial attention will be on our most influential institutions: work, education, religion, and the criminal justice system.

The most populous African nation, Nigeria, shows similar inequality among its major ethnic nationalities. This magnitude of inequality among ethnic nationalities has given rise to serious problems in inter-group relations in the three countries.

Is a copy the same thing as a reproduction, replication, repetition, imitation, duplicate, or facsimile? And what of related terms such as fake, forgery or counterfeit? Throughout history artists have addressed the work of others, and sometimes their own work, from the point of view of imitating it, appropriating it, and refashioning it. As a practice copying in its many forms has underpinned the production of art since earliest times. As a theory imitation precedes notions of authenticity and originality, and may be said to bring these latter concepts into being.

We have to learn to see them as they might have been seen. We can begin to do this by learning how to read and to interpret the complex elements at play beneath the immediate surface by setting the artist, his work, and his public in their social and religious historical contexts, and by exploring the universal unspoken language of signs and symbols used by artists. The course content is based on painted forms, i.e., panels, canvases, and frescos from the Trecento and Quattrocento with an emphasis on Tuscan painting.

What, then, is the relationship between politics and art, particularly during dramatic events of social and political upheaval? How does radical art correspond to radical politics, and what are the limits of each? What role does violence play in the production of revolutionary images? With these questions in mind, students will learn how the study of art can illuminate how these past revolts, rebellions, and insurrections that happened across Europe and its colonial territories continue to shape geopolitics today."

Along with these examples we will consider topics such Baroque architecture in Central and South America, early photographs of the Middle East, and the documenting of the voyages of discovery to the Pacific, as well as the work of native America artists who have engaged in a post-colonial critique of western aesthetics and art practices."

Is a copy the same thing as a reproduction, replication, repetition, imitation, duplicate, or facsimile? And what of related terms such as fake, forgery or counterfeit? Throughout history artists have addressed the work of others, and sometimes their own work, from the point of view of imitating it, appropriating it, and refashioning it. As a practice copying in its many forms has underpinned the production of art since earliest times. As a theory imitation precedes notions of authenticity and originality, and may be said to bring these latter concepts into being. This course will examine copying across the full range visual media \u2013 painting, sculpture, architecture, printmaking photography, film and new media."

From the hard-edged paintings of Neo-Classicism that came of age during the French Revolution, to the abstractions of Constructivism that gave form to the Bolshevik cause in Russia, the admixture of radical politics and avant-garde aesthetics has always defined the emergence of modern art. What, then, is the relationship between politics and art, particularly during dramatic events of social and political upheaval? How does radical art correspond to radical politics, and what are the limits of each? What role does violence play in the production of revolutionary images? With these questions in mind, students will learn how the study of art can illuminate how these past revolts, rebellions, and insurrections that happened across Europe and its colonial territories continue to shape geopolitics today."

We will look very closely at Leonardo\u2019s writings and drawings.

First, it will enable readers to analyze and evaluate how anthropologists create ethnographic knowledge. How do ethnographers make and interpret data within more or less explicit conceptual frameworks? Second, it will introduce students to the vast cultural diversity of New Guinea and its neighboring islands and to how this region (Melanesia) has played a central role in the history of anthropological theory and method. The course is thus a general inquiry into the practice of ethnography, including fieldwork and writing, carried out through a close reading of materials from one particular area of the world. Readings include 20th century classics by authors such as Bronislaw Malinowski and Margaret Mead as well as recent ethnographic writings about contemporary Papua New Guine"

You will design your own experiments, construct new genetic parts, and validate the constructs using new characterization assays. In addition to the wet-lab research, iGEM involves mathematical modeling to predict the behavior and guide the design of the new biological parts and characterization assays. Students also design, construct, characterize, and improve their own piece of hardware that will work together with the designed biological organism. The policy and practice component addresses the social, legal, and ethical issues of the project. iGEM is multi-disciplinary, highly collaborative, and student-managed. You will travel to Boston and interact with 300 universities from all over the world."

Within a French context, how does the historical representation of blackness, from slavery to the contemporary moment by way of colonization, inform the current black experience? Paris represented a space of freedom and artistic glory that African American writers, soldiers and artists were denied back home. However, for those caught in poor suburbs, calls to mind images of riots, dilapidated schools, the Black America has come to embody the new land of hope. Rap music and hip-hop, elements of transnational black imagination that sometimes speaks the language of the Black Lives Matter movement, are the soundtrack of this new Black Paris. This course captures, through readings and film enhanced with a visit of Black Paris, the promise and the challenges of Black Paris."

      "description": "The final decades of China's Qing dynasty (1644\u00ad-1911) bore witness to great political, economic, and social change. Periods of inter\u00adethnic tensions, famine, rebellion, war, semi-colonization, and finally revolution all contributed to a rapidly changing landscape for the subjects of the Qing dynasty. In this class, we will read (in translation) prominent works of fiction and nonfiction from the 19th and early 20th centuries, paying particular attention to the emergence of class, racial, ethnic, and nationalist consciousnesses\u037e tropes of Qing corruption and moral decay; discourses of \u201cmodernity\u201d; and the growing belief that literacy and popular fiction would play a vital role in the development of post-dynastic civic society."

The four in-depth ANSEL experiments are designed to help recreate a type of well-rounded, competent experimental nuclear scientist who is able to analyze an experimental problem, to select, design, and set up appropriate nuclear instrumentation, and to conduct required measurements. The laboratory sessions will meet twice a week for 2 hours and 40 minutes. The students are expected to write detailed lab reports on their work, and give a presentation on of their experiments at the end of the semester. In addition to the laboratory component of ANSEL students will attend a weekly lecture (1 hour and 15 minutes per week)."

The films selected for the screenings touch on these issues both explicitly and implicitly; through a brief introduction to the main approaches in film analysis and criticism the students will learn how to go beyond a simple thematic reading of the works so as to embrace a more sophisticated multilayered approach which will reveal hidden meanings and intents that will help to construct a more comprehensive picture of Italy's recent past."

What distinguishes them are the unique lenses through which they recount history, offering glimpses of how love, in particular, becomes entangled in politics and war: in Bassani's story, a town ostracizes an older resident for his relationship with a young man during the rise of Fascism; in Fenoglio's tale, a partisan\u2019s memories of his beloved veer him off course during the Resistance; and in Ginzburg's account, a woman relates her antifascist Jewish family\u2019s trials and tribulations under dictatorship.

Young translators will be exposed to a lot of practical advice throughout this class, helping to refine their approach to their own translations, and will expand their understanding of various practices and possibilities for the art and craft of literary translation."

This feature raises the possibility that certain data formerly kept in files might instead reside \"in memory\" across program runs and even system crashes. We will explore the rapidly expanding literature on this subject, and pursue group projects that extend the state of the art. topics to be addressed include device technology; architectural support (instruction set, memory model); operating system support (virtual memory ad file system integration, failure detection and recovery initiation); run-time systems (failure atomicity via locks and/or transactions); formal correctness criteria; dynamic memory allocation; and driving applications."

Then we examine the important issue of noise with the design example of low-noise amplifiers (LNA). Nonlinear circuits are studied next with the examples of mixers. A study of oscillators and phase noise follows. Afterwards we introduce phase-locked loops (PLL) and frequency synthesizers. The course concludes with an overview of transceivers architectures. The course emphasizes the development of both circuit design intuition and analytical skills.

Then we examine the important issue of noise with the design example of low-noise amplifiers (LNA). Nonlinear circuits are studied next with the examples of mixers. A study of oscillators and phase noise follows. Afterwards we introduce phase-locked loops (PLL) and frequency synthesizers. The course concludes with an overview of transceivers architectures. The course emphasizes the development of both circuit design intuition and analytical skills.

The most populous African nation, Nigeria, shows similar inequality among its major ethnic nationalities. This magnitude of inequality among ethnic nationalities has given rise to serious problems in inter-group relations in the three countries.

In this practical class, students will build simple biogeochemical models-ranging from \"box\" models of marine microbial ecosystems to three-dimensional nutrient cycling models-and design experiments to address climate change hypotheses. They will also be taught to analyze output from state-of-the-art climate models used by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Students will not only learn invaluable programming skills, but also gain a deeper intuition of the ocean carbon cycling and its role in the global climate system."

Are there situations in which every available action is wrong?"

Topics to be studied include philosophical approaches to the Anthropocene (a new geologic era proposed by scientists), strategies deployed by documentary and Hollywood film, and a new works of \"climate fiction.\" A central concern of this course is the relationship between science and the humanities in the understanding the environment.

The nineteenth century witnessed the rise of industrialism, rapid imperialist expansion, religious crisis, increasing democracy, and shifts in gender and class identity. In exploring this tumultuous time period, the course will focus on an array of novelists, poets, and essayists who will serve as touchstones for the key political, intellectual, and aesthetic problems of their times (e.g. Blake, Wordsworth, Keats, Bront\u00eb, Browning, Ruskin, Yeats, and Woolf).

In looking at these, we will consider both the approaches that key scholars in the field of media studies use, and the concepts that are central to the field itself (media/medium; medium-specificity; remediation; the culture industry; reification and utopia; cultural politics).

I use it here very loosely to mean any fiction that takes for its subject something fantastic or whimsical, whether its setting is contemporary, historical, futuristic, or alternative. Actually, science fiction falls under the very large umbrella of \"Fantasy,\" which used to dominate creative writings before the introduction of the \"novel.\" This course is not, per se, a course on \"genre\" literature--a term I loathe because even \"literary\" or \"mainstream\" fiction has \"genres.\" I am interested in leading you to write short fiction that straddles conventional generic boundaries, such as the work of Margaret Atwood, A.S. Byatt, Jorge Luis Borges, Italo Calvino, Jonathan Lethem and China Mieville, leader of the \"New Weird.\""

So what do copy editors do? Is copyediting simply about enforcing rules of correctness? When is it okay to break those rules, or to allow others to do so, and what guides such decisions? How do copy editors understand and negotiate the relationships and interests of readers, writers, and the publications they work for? How has the information age changed the way copy editors think about and approach textual editing? In this class we will address both the principles and practices of copyediting. Students will learn the principles that guide copy editors, and then put these principles into use in a workshop setting, practicing copyediting in a variety of contexts, including digital communications."

Guest lectures by staff of the Moving Image Department of George Eastman Museum provide a first-hand look at analog film and its preservation in action, allowing us to consider it as an ephemeral form of material culture: a multipurpose, visual record that is in addition to being art, entertainment, and evidentiary document, also an historical artifact. There are weekly film assignments. Class meets at George Eastman Museum and on River Campus (transportation provided)."

When you watch a Hitchcock film, you are meant to be acutely aware that it is Hitchcock\u2019s film. This course examines how exactly that works.More than a proper noun, \u201cHitchcock\u201d implies a formal style, a dramatic genre and a paradigm of postwar Autuerism and influence. This course revolves around a close examination of fifteen out of the director\u2019s fifty films, as well as samples from his television series. Without pardoning his socially insensitive shortcomings (i.e. misogynist \u201cheros,\u201d mistreatment of leading ladies, use of blackface, etc.) we will unpack just what constitutes the \u201cHitchcock\u201d touch. From his British silents to his Hollywood \u201cmasterpieces\u201d to his final works, this course considers the ways in which Hitchcock devised a relation among narrative, spectator and character point of view, so as to yield his singular configuration of suspense, sensation and perception."

As we read, language, fantasy, and thought in literature combine in a social and political gesture. For most literature, we remember stories and characters, but rarely words. Literary language acts on us mostly without our awareness. With attention to a variety of genres of fiction, poetry, drama, and popular song lyrics, the seminar estimates the social and political speech action of literary language. Seminar members are invited to re-use the language of the works on the reading list by placing this language in new contexts and then comparing the new usages with those experienced in reading. Works on the reading list, which raise issues of language action, suggest how such actions appear in any literature. Authors studied include Dickinson, Kafka, Lawrence, Morrison, Olds, Orwell, Pinter, and Shakespeare. Obscene language is considered as a model of how literary language is politically active."

We\u2019ll read it in the original Old English and in translation, and as your lareow (teaching-slave) I\u2019ll help you sharpen your knowledge of OE grammar and vocabulary and learn its history and development.

They also gain a perspective on the Biblical, Christian, and Classical traditions as they intersect with the multiple levels of Dante\u2019s concern, ranging from literature to history, from politics to government, from philosophy to theology.

As authors experimented with new modes of portraying consciousness and the external world, and explored new ideas about plot, character, and narrative voice, they questioned what the novel could do: how does the novel, as opposed to other genres, approach the relationship between reality and representation? Does it imply a new kind of reading experience? a new kind of reader? Does it owe its existence to certain historical, social, or cultural circumstances?

The poems we write may take any shape, any form, but we will work towards understanding why a particular poem must take the shape it has; we will pay attention not so much to what the poems say as to how they say it. Requirements: weekly writing and reading assignments, revisions of assignments, devoted participation in class discussions, a final project."

How can critics and researchers deal with the inaccessibility of so much television from even the recent past, much less more distant decades? What archeologies of television are possible? How is television related to wider cultural formations--from other media and arts to the lived experiences of race, gender, sexuality, and class? What do answers to these questions tell us about what it means to watch TV? The course will mix reading about and watching television in pursuing answers to these questions"

Since the mid-20 century, television has occupied a central place in U.S. cultural production and thus serves as a nexus where concerns with gender as well as sexuality, class, and race are negotiated. To interrogate these negotiations, the course will attend to the shifts in the industrial arrangement of television and to corresponding shifts in television\u2019s formal arrangement. It asks not only how gender has been represented on television but also how gender functions in the television industry and how it functions within a televisual aesthetic. It traces the role of gender in many of television studies prominent theories: flow, liveness, televisuality, quality TV, and media convergence. The course will cover both nonfiction and fiction, looking at a range of television genres: sitcom, soap operas, news, primetime drama, cartoons, music videos, commercials, and Netflix original content."

In looking at these, we will consider both the approaches that key scholars in the field of media studies use, and the concepts that are central to the field itself (media/medium; medium-specificity; remediation; the culture industry; reification and utopia; cultural politics).

In fact, the 1930s was a decade of diverse artistic experiments in the United States\u2014a veritable laboratory for debating art\u2019s forms and social aims that would come to redefine American culture itself. This course introduces a range of those experiments, focusing on the network between film and the other visual arts. Topics include federally sponsored New Deal programs, the social realisms of African-American and immigrant artists, the rise of photo-journalism and emergence of \u201cdocumentary\u201d across mediums, the aesthetic diplomacy of World\u2019s Fairs and films such as Capra\u2019s American Madness, Lang\u2019s Fury, and Ford\u2019s Grapes of Wrath. Throughout the course we will be asking in what ways did these experiments represent propositions about the direction and shape of modern art and culture in America."

The perspective of the course is historical and critical. The key assumption is that media\u2014the human voice, manuscripts, printed books, telegrams, photos, film, TV, paintings, electronic files--shape their \"content\"--words, pictures, sounds\u2014and also shape their authors and their audiences. There have always been media because life cannot be lived without them. We are now experiencing a digital revolution. This remarkable media shift puts us among the first explorers to arrive on the scene of epoch-making changes. We should take advantage of our own unique intellectual opportunity to look back on the history of media from the powerful new perspective of digital media\u2014and also to contemplate the great void that no medium has yet filled, the spaces of communication that we cannot yet cross."

Recurrent iconography and coded images link tourism and educational objects and images with evolving concepts of nationalism and cultural identity. How is the meaning of modern in Japan useful to a study of the continuous transformation of culture in specific contexts, as in the transition from ukiyo-e culture to photography and animated films.

When you watch a Hitchcock film, you are meant to be acutely aware that it is Hitchcock\u2019s film. This course examines how exactly that works.More than a proper noun, \u201cHitchcock\u201d implies a formal style, a dramatic genre and a paradigm of postwar Autuerism and influence. This course revolves around a close examination of fifteen out of the director\u2019s fifty films, as well as samples from his television series. Without pardoning his socially insensitive shortcomings (i.e. misogynist \u201cheros,\u201d mistreatment of leading ladies, use of blackface, etc.) we will unpack just what constitutes the \u201cHitchcock\u201d touch. From his British silents to his Hollywood \u201cmasterpieces\u201d to his final works, this course considers the ways in which Hitchcock devised a relation among narrative, spectator and character point of view, so as to yield his singular configuration of suspense, sensation and perception."

      "description": "How does Black Paris, as the lived experience of today marginalized immigrants, as a site of the production of a certain understanding of blackness, contribute to our understanding of the global black condition? This course is a study of Black Paris, as imagined by generations of Black cultural producers. Paris is a space of freedom and artistic glory that African American writers, soldiers and artists were denied back home. For students from French colonies, Paris was the birthplace of Negritude, the cultural renaissance informed by the Harlem Renaissance. Black Paris, for those caught in poor suburbs, calls to mind images of riots, dilapidated schools, but also rap music and hip-hop, elements of transnational black imagination that sometimes speaks the language of the Black Lives Matter movement.

This course will take up these questions through the philosophical tradition of libertinism in early modern France. During this historical period, libertines were both celebrated and critiqued for their tendency to flout political and social norms. We will explore the limits and possibilities of the libertine tradition through its myriad manifestations in the seventeenth and eighteenth century. We will read libertine texts that tackle questions of sexuality and consent, political protest, and the scientific imagination. We will also consider the relationship between early modern libertinism and our contemporary moment. Readings will include: Bergerac, \"L'Autre Monde: ou les \u00c9tats et Empires de la Lune\"; Ch\u00e2telet, \"Discours sur le bonheur\"; Laclos, \"Les Liaisons Dangereuses\"; Moli\u00e8re, \"Dom Juan.\""

The course interprets this tradition as both the production of American writers of African descent and as being associated with black cultural traditions. Definitions and meaning of race, the construction of black identity, intra-racial differences of class, gender, and sexuality, the claims African American writers have made for the relationship of literary art to their sense of self and the world around them, and the potentialities of literature to represent and to influence society and politics will be of particular interest. Students will offer presentations, write short responses / analyses, and a longer final paper."

Although these reformations had worldwide consequences, the focus here will be on the events in sixteenth-century Europe. Students will learn to appreciate the complicated history of religious changes during the early modern period without succumbing to confessional rectitude. The themes and subjects studied in the course are relevant for those interested in medieval and modern history. Theology is but one part of this course with the place of print technology, vernacularization, and political mobilization in the reformations also receiving significant attention throughout the semester."

Forged in the 1780s by black north Atlantic mariners, the solidarity would encompass many areas of life before and during the apartheid era. This course explores four of those areas: evangelical ties connecting African American churches with South Africa\u2019s independent church organizations; the spread of Booker T. Washington\u2019s educational ideals in black South African academic circles; the impact of the Harlem Renaissance on African popular township culture; and the cross-fertilization of political ideologies originating on both sides of the Atlantic: Africans fighting against apartheid learned important lessons from the crusades of anti-colonial activists and internationalists in the diaspora, such as Marcus Garvey, Paul Robeson, and Mahatma Gandhi."

This course will explore the historical forces in the United States and Mexico that have produced a physical barrier between the two nations and the cultural war that now separates their peoples. It will look at the wall as a substitute for economic and cultural forces that cannot be diverted without massive changes in Washington, DC. and Mexico City first. Trump\u2019s use of the wall inflames public sentiment and may seem to provide an answer to cultural malaise in the USA. But ultimately, it drives attention away from the true sources of conflict and provides no meaningful answers to a series of problems that have been decades in the making."

There is a crisis, and this course introduces students to the predicament, arguing that since the first Industrial Revolution in England, the peoples of North Africa and the Middle East have refashioned their destinies in partnership with the West. Students will examine how the following encounters helped make the region as we know it: the Anglo-Turkish Convention of 1838, transition from Ottoman to West European colonialism, discovery of huge and easily extractable oil reserves, creation of the state of Israel, the Iranian Revolution of 1979, and the US Invasion of Iraq in 2003. The class will also explore how the above patterns of engagement shaped the histories of the region\u2019s working classes, women, and the peasantry."

Aspects of Italian culture that will be touched upon include the so-called \u201cSouthern Question\u201d relating to the economic differences between Italy\u2019s Northern and Southern regions, the Resistance against Nazi Fascism, the post-war reconstruction, the internal migration of the Southerners towards the industrial North, the condition of women within Italian society, and the youth culture. The films selected for the screenings touch on these issues both explicitly and implicitly; through a brief introduction to the main approaches in film analysis and criticism the students will learn how to go beyond a simple thematic reading of the works so as to embrace a more sophisticated multilayered approach which will reveal hidden meanings and intents that will help to construct a more comprehensive picture of Italy's recent past."

We have to learn to see them as they might have been seen. We can begin to do this by learning how to read and to interpret the complex elements at play beneath the immediate surface by setting the artist, his work, and his public in their social and religious historical contexts, and by exploring the universal unspoken language of signs and symbols used by artists. The course content is based on painted forms, i.e., panels, canvases, and frescos from the Trecento and Quattrocento with an emphasis on Tuscan painting.

      "description": "The years following the Second World War saw an outpouring of novels in Italy, all attempting to capture the realities of the tumultuous period just passed. In this course, we will explore three of the era's most remarkable works: Giorgio Bassani's The Gold-Rimmed Spectacles, Beppe Fenoglio's A Private Affair and Natalia Ginzburg's Family Lexicon. What distinguishes them are the unique lenses through which they recount history, offering glimpses of how love, in particular, becomes entangled in politics and war: in Bassani's story, a town ostracizes an older resident for his relationship with a young man during the rise of Fascism; in Fenoglio's tale, a partisan\u2019s memories of his beloved veer him off course during the Resistance; and in Ginzburg's account, a woman relates her antifascist Jewish family\u2019s trials and tribulations under dictatorship. Assignments include: historical, biographical and critical readings, short papers and a final essay. All readings will be in English."

Drawing on work in mostly pre-theoretical, descriptive linguistics this course reveals the mechanics of Standard English structure, with occasional detours into the finesse of usage across registers (dialect to slang). Students will learn to develop the ability to see patterns in grammar, as well as its structural possibilities and limits. Assignments will regularly involve reflection on form, usage and speaker judgments. Through a final project, students will investigate some aspect of an English variety available to them. Throughout, students will be working with their data samples of English to explore how speaker choices lead to particular grammatical structures or yield ungrammaticality.

By reading a series of recently translated works (some contemporary, some retranslations of modern classics), and by talking with translators, we will have the opportunity to discuss both specific and general issues that come up while translating a given text. Young translators will be exposed to a lot of practical advice throughout this class, helping to refine their approach to their own translations, and will expand their understanding of various practices and possibilities for the art and craft of literary translation."

It plays a vital role in biblical thought, ancient Greek philosophy and mysticism, scholastic theology, nineteenth century romantic literature, ancient and modern mathematics, and physics. A small sample of the questions we will explore are: 1) How is it possible to even think about the infinite? 2) What does it mean for God to be infinite? 3) The infinite or the finite, which is better, and why has the answer differed in different cultures? Readings will be from numerous sources, including Plato, Aristotle, Euclid, Aquinas, Nicholas of Cusa, Bruno, Newton, Berkeley, Blake, Wordsworth, Cantor, and Borges. The course should fit well into various mathematics and humanities clusters. Cross referenced with PHL 199 and CLA 199"

It has scaled multiple generations in feature size and in speed while keeping the same power densities. However,CMOS finally encounters fundamental limits. The course is intended for students interested in research frontiers of future electronics technologies. The course begins with introduction to the basic physics of magnetism and of quantum mechanical spin. Then it covers aspects of spin transport with emphasis on spin-diffusion in semiconductors. The second part of the course is comprised of student and lecturer presentations of selected spintronics topics which may include: spin transistors, magnetic random access memories, spin-based logic paradigms, spin-based lasers and light emitting diodes, magnetic semiconductors, spin-torque devices for memory applications and the spin Hall effect."

For the first half of the course, general numerical analysis topics are reviewed such as linear algebra, ODE and PDE. Through homework assignments, students write their own computer code. Sufficient sample solutions are given to practice various numerical methods within limited time. The rest of the course is comprised of case studies and projects. Examples of computational analyses are drawn from life science problems such as biodynamics of human loco motion, ion channel kinetics, ionic diffusion, and finite element analysis of cells/tissues. For final project, students bring their own research problems, express them in mathematical equations, solve them using custom written computer programs and interpret the solutions."

It is intended for highly motivated students in their senior year with a strong inclination toward medical school or other clinical practice. The student will learn about clinical diagnostic methods, practice differential diagnosis and treatment planning through simulated (virtual) cases, and shadow clinicians as part of this course. Students will also engage with primary research literature to understand underlying pathological mechanisms for diseases such as stroke, cancer, epilepsy as well as neuropathic pain and traumatic brain injury."

It has scaled multiple generations in feature size and in speed while keeping the same power densities. However,CMOS finally encounters fundamental limits. The course is intended for students interested in research frontiers of future electronics technologies. The course begins with introduction to the basic physics of magnetism and of quantum mechanical spin. Then it covers aspects of spin transport with emphasis on spin-diffusion in semiconductors. The second part of the course is comprised of student and lecturer presentations of selected spintronics topics which may include: spin transistors, magnetic random access memories, spin-based logic paradigms, spin-based lasers and light emitting diodes, magnetic semiconductors, spin-torque devices for memory applications and the spin Hall effect."

In this class students will focus on the \u2018big questions\u2019 surrounding race: What is race? Can race be measured \u2013 and, if so, how? How have questions about race and ethnicity shaped American legal, social, cultural, and political institutions? How have Americans thought about race and immigration throughout the 21st century, and how have these opinions shaped political engagement and behavior? This course will focus on political science theories and research about race and politics, though we will also draw on work from history, sociology, law, and economics."

How does the brain develop the ability to accomplish these tasks? What regions of the brain are involved and what computations do they perform? How is this neural machinery affected by the social environment and psychiatric illness? In this course, we will examine the latest research in human social neuroscience towards answering these and related questions."

We have two main goals ahead of us in this course: to read the major extant works of drama in Middle English, and to stage a medieval play. Along the way, we will discuss the texts themselves, the manuscript history of the surviving plays, their performance history, their relation to drama on the Continent, the religious opposition to them, sixteenth-century attempts to de-Catholicize them, their ultimate suppression after the Reformation, and their revival in twentieth-century England and North America."

      "description": "This course is a survey of the major literary achievements by women writers in Russia and the Soviet Union. While seldom studied as a cohesive literary tradition, women writers have made tremendous contributions to the Russian literary canon and continue to shape the trajectory of Russian literature to this day. The readings for this course will cover major literary genres, including prose, poetry, memoir and drama from the nineteenth century to the present. Primary sources will be examined alongside theoretical readings. Lectures and discussions will explore questions of gender, genre and the socio-historical evolution of the female subject within the Russian literary canon."

This literature\u2014banned in the Soviet Union until a few years before its collapse \u2014constitutes a unique body of fiction that exists on the border between two cultures: that of the writers\u2019 abandoned Russian homeland and that of their adopted home country.

Performance art often blurs the boundaries between art & life & often encourages us to reconsider our beliefs regarding spirituality, identity, body, space, politics, & the definition of art itself. In this studio art class, we will look at the most fascinating performance artists from the 1960s to the present while designing our own \"live sculptures\" & \"time-based art.\" No previous knowledge of performance art is necessary. This course may be taken more than once for advanced-level credit. Permission of instructor required. Studio art supplies fee: $50."

We address the study of progressively complex grammatical structures in order to attain communicative competence, and to expose students to different forms of cultural production in the Spanish language. Limited to 12 students. Major, minor, and cluster credit."

How far does our moral duty to aid distant strangers extend? What sorts of political and socioeconomic principles are morally justifiable? Do animals have moral rights? How should we understand the meaning and value of life and death? We will also explore related general questions: Is it always possible for a good enough end to justify bad means?

Are there situations in which every available action is wrong?"

After the discussion of RLC circuits, high-frequency narrow-band amplifiers are studied, followed by broadband amplifiers. Then we examine the important issue of noise with the design example of low-noise amplifiers (LNA). Nonlinear circuits are studied next with the examples of mixers. A study of oscillators and phase noise follows. Afterwards we introduce phase-locked loops (PLL) and frequency synthesizers. The course concludes with an overview of transceivers architectures. The course emphasizes the development of both circuit design intuition and analytical skills. There are bi-weekly design labs and a term project using industry-standard EDA tools (ADS, Asitic, etc.)."

We examine representations of college, how each constructs its object, and how construction affects lived experience.

Our main object of analysis is the language used to describe college; we review the impact of descriptions as much as the experience itself.

And while some questions about food can only be answered by eating it, this course will primarily explore evaluative questions about food that we can answer in writing, such as: What is food? Are there objective facts about taste? Can food belong to a culture? Are there foods we should not eat? Which laws about food are best? Writing about food will facilitate our becoming better writers while sharpening our skills in argumentation and critical thinking. We will learn from scientists, artists, chefs, anthropologists, philosophers, as well as experiences of tasting and creating food with our class. Course texts are primarily scholarly articles but also include magazines, podcasts, blogs, videos, and social media. Assignments include in-class writing, formal and informal writing assignments, and an audio podcast. The formal assignments, including an 8-10 page argumentative research paper, will undergo revision, reflection, and peer review."

Through what means does language effectively persuade, defend, or even harm others? How and why does violence materialize across different genres and media? In this class, we will address forms of violence, such as physical, rhetorical, and institutional, and explore language\u2019s role in creating literary and real-life violence. Our encounters with violence in plays, films, and social doctrines will help us understand the repercussions of our own rhetoric. We will learn to develop productive writing processes by analyzing sources and practicing peer feedback, reflection, and revision. After writing three short papers, we will critically investigate our individual interests and interpretations of violence in a final 8-10-page argumentative research paper. Course materials may include works by W. Shakespeare, V. Martin, F. Coppola, and others. WARNING: violent, graphic content."

      "description": "There is a common belief that the state of modernity is a thoroughly disenchanted one\u2014that society has replaced a need for magic with cold steel and microchips, and that fantasy is only fit for children. Yet the idea of magic is alive and well in literature, popular culture and public discourse. How does fantasy, whether understood as a genre or as a particular function of the imagination, operate within its contemporary cultural landscape? What is the value of enchantment in our supposedly \u201cdisenchanted\u201d world? Students will craft their own answers to these questions in connection with texts depicting various forms of enchantment and the fantastic. Assigned texts may include Shakespeare\u2019s The Tempest, Hiyao Miyazaki\u2019s film Howl\u2019s Moving Castle, and short works of magical realism. Students will develop their critical thinking and writing skills through a series of short assignments, peer feedback, reflection and revision, working towards an 8-10 page argumentative research paper at the end of the semester."

We as a society must make choices about spending, balancing the desire to achieve the best possible health for everyone with the reality of limited resources. Underlying these decisions are ethical and practical concerns, and any policy requires answers to many questions. For instance, which diseases get the most attention? Are contagious diseases in a different class from heart disease and cancer? When may we infringe on someone\u2019s rights in the name of better health? We will examine these questions, drawing on newspaper articles, TED talks, policy blogs, and scholarly sources that examine the sociological, psychological, economic, ethical, and medical aspects of these questions.

Throughout, students will be working with their data samples of English to explore how speaker choices lead to particular grammatical structures or yield ungrammaticality. Background in linguistics or grammar not needed."

So what do copy editors do? Is copyediting simply about enforcing rules of correctness? When is it okay to break those rules, or to allow others to do so, and what guides such decisions? How do copy editors understand and negotiate the relationships and interests of readers, writers, and the publications they work for? How has the information age changed the way copy editors think about and approach textual editing? In this class we will address both the principles and practices of copyediting. Students will learn the principles that guide copy editors, and then put these principles into use in a workshop setting, practicing copyediting in a variety of contexts, including digital communications."

In this course, students are invited to dig deeply into a question of interest, write for a public audience, and use the Internet as an archive of information waiting to be discovered, analyzed, and written about. Students can draw on pre-existing research interests from their majors or develop a line of inquiry stemming from class discussions, writing, and research. In order to gain experience writing to a range of readers, students will engage in a writing process informed by peer review, self-assessment, and revision. Shorter writing assignments will help students develop and refine ideas as they transform texts for different audiences. The final research project will be multimodal, published for a public audience, and should demonstrate your ability to think critically about a topic and effectively communicate that knowledge to a range of readers."

You will develop a technical vocabulary and set of skills that allow you to describe recurring patterns and writer choices within those patterns. Using these tools, and talking to experts in your chosen discipline(s), you will investigate disciplinary and interdisciplinary boundaries, how writers convey meaning in different situations, and why they make the writing choices they do. Through a final research project of your choice, you will practice using what you have learned to communicate the results of your own research. This course is especially suitable for dual-major students, or those heading to graduate or health professions schools."

We\u2019ll explore a range of potentially high-stakes cases involving textual, audiovisual, and multimodal renditions of a source text. These may include translating an ad or museum label; subbing a TED Talk or performance; dubbing in anime or games; interpreting for business, medical, or other purposes. Along with course readings and short experimental translations, students will work with our paraprofessional consultants and community partners in SW Rochester to craft final projects that provide a meaningful extension of course learning to real-world issues (Counts toward the Citation in Community-Engaged Scholarship; see Authentically Urban, Virtually Global: Southwest Rochester)."

In this course students will explore their professional interests, identities, and goals in order to identify relevant audiences. Based on their audience and purpose, students will focus on making effective choices about platform, style, content, and design in order to create their own portfolios. Using self-reflection as well as peer and instructor feedback, students will revise and refine their work across the semester.

Analysts make buy, sell, and hold recommendations based on analysis of financial information; 3) creditors and lenders use financial statement information as input into lending decisions. Lenders use financial information to determine the type, amount and terms of a loan, and also the nature of any covenants, and 4) corporations and investment bankers use financial statements to value companies that might be takeover targets. The primary objective is to develop and sharpen students' analytical ability to analyze financial statements and draw inferences about a firm's performance and future prospects."

Effective tax planning requires the planner, in making investment and financing decisions, to consider not only explicit taxes (tax dollars paid directly to taxing authorities), but also implicit taxes (taxes paid indirectly in the form of lower before-tax rates of return on tax-favored investments). Effective tax planning requires the planner to recognize that taxes represent only one among many business costs.

The study of accruals naturally leads to research on earnings management that focuses on how and why earnings are managed.

The analysis of entrepreneurship is evaluated primarily from the perspective of a start-up venture that requires equity capital investment. Management issues discussed include organizational development, analysis of market opportunities, market engagement, financial planning and control, capitalization, sources of funds, the due-diligence process and valuing the venture.\nAn important reason for taking this course is to learn how to develop a business plan. Therefore, a significant component of a student's final grade will be based on this. In too many instances, a new venture does not become a viable entity because either there is no plan, or if there is, it is poorly conceived. Furthermore, a good plan is an effective communications tool for the investment community. An additional benefit is learning to work in multidisciplinary teams."

The investment theory part starts from partial equilibrium (mean-variance analysis) and proceeds with general equilibrium (CAPM). We test it with the data, discuss factor models and anomalies, and use it to evaluate the efficiency of markets. We then study derivatives (options, forwards, futures and swaps). Replication strategies are used to price derivatives, and the binomial model of option pricing is derived. We conclude with the Black-Scholes formula.

Internships allow students to work in business settings/situations in which they receive on-the-job training from management personnel and gain valuable practical experience in performing professional-level tasks in their area(s) of concentration. GBA 490, which cannot be used to complete a concentration in the M.B.A. program, is open only to non-U.S. students who are eligible to work in the United States. Upon completion of the internship assignment, the student must prepare a 10- to 12-page report detailing its outcome(s) and stating whether the proposed learning objectives were met."

The techniques you learn in this class provide a systematic method of asking questions, collecting data, and analyzing that data to learn how processes work (or are failing) and what can be changed to improve them. The statistical techniques you will learn are SPC (Statistical Process Control, used as a proactive tool for investigation rather than its traditional role as a reactive tool), MSA (Measurement Systems Analysis, for determining if your measurement system is capable), FMEA (Failure Modes and Effects Analysis), and DOE (Design of Experiments). In addition to these analysis tools, there will be a strong emphasis on the proc\u00adess of data acquisition. To support the process of acquiring the right data and learning the analysis tools, you will do a small outside project for the class and a series of in-class simulations."

The seminar will cover some the following topics: time measurement; linear and cyclic time; Isomorphism of pitch to time; ratios connecting time, rhythm, timbre, form; formal and informal time; Objective, inter-subjective, and subjective time; Stockhausen\u2019s experiential time; Kramer\u2019s vertical time; time in and out; temporal relativity; the spatialization of time; temporal construction from events versus time as a container; arguments for the illusion or non-existence of time; Bergson\u2019s \u201cduration\u201d; the specious present; time and being (Heidegger and Dogen). Several class presentations on readings; one final paper or a composition with an essay about its temporal organization and orientation."

An emphasis on versatility, creativity and innovation has become integral to discussions about the future of music and the arts, but our understanding of these concepts remains elusive.  Music is an interdisciplinary endeavor, and the goal of this course is to explore how diverse academic disciplines and cultural perspectives can help us better understand the ecology of creativity. Working collaboratively toward this goal, students will research an aspect of their musicianship in depth as they explore and apply ideas about creativity to music, and develop a framework for evaluating the many different approaches to this topic.  This course is useful for advanced non-native speakers of English, as well as students interested in developing professional skills in an intercultural environment."

Provocative, sometimes absurd, and often radical, a broader definition of performance overflows traditional \"Aristotelian\" theater to question the boundaries between representation and reality, audience and stage, sense and non-sense, music and sound, and body and self. In this class we will depart from traditional theater to study significant performances of the last 100 years, and what their creators and critics said about them. Cross-listed with ENG 259."

The ensemble combines the iconic djembe hand drum with a trio of drums played with sticks, known as dunun, sangban, and kenkeni. The powerful, multi-part relationships established by this trio of drums provide a rhythmic foundation for the ensemble, enabling djembe players to develop technique in executing both accompaniment and solo parts. Drawing upon his experience as a soloist with the internationally acclaimed groups Les Percussions de Guin\u00e9e and Les Ballets Africains, Fana engages ensemble players with a wide repertory of music from various regions of Guinea, including the rhythms of the Susu, Malinke, and Baga language groups."

It will provide a historical overview of the field, highlighting many of the important figures and works that have marked the discipline\u2019s history and have led to shifts in the way ethnomusicologists understand the relationship of music, society, and culture. We will explore what it is that an ethnomusicologist does (or once did) by studying a variety of approaches to fieldwork methods and ethnographic representation. We will explore several theoretical orientations\u2014drawing from the disciplines of anthropology, linguistics, performance theory, media studies, and philosophy\u2014that inform the work of past and present ethnomusicologists, and introduce a range of musical styles, practices, and ways of thinking about sound in different parts of the world through the study of select musical ethnographies."

Horror and thriller films are linked by their insistence upon intriguing and exciting an audience in often disquieting ways. Why do we find films that focus on situations _we_ would be most uncomfortable in fascinating? And also, do these reflect other social and artistic movements of their various periods, and where might these movements come from? "

The Philharmonic, the Opera, the Parliament, the Film Studio served different purposes during Imperial, Nazi, Divided, and Unified Berlin and reflect Germany\u2019s changing values in the arts, culture, and politics. What role did classical music play under different regimes? What does a building\u2019s design teach us about its builders\u2019 mission? This course also offers the option of a two-week study abroad component during the last two weeks of May. We will travel to Berlin and Freiburg to visit the sites we studied and engage in further historical exploration on location. We will conclude the trip with a week -long visit at our partner conservatory, the Musikhochschule Freiburg for an immersive experience in German musical training."

Provocative, sometimes absurd, and often radical, a broader definition of performance overflows traditional \"Aristotelian\" theater to question the boundaries between representation and reality, audience and stage, sense and non-sense, music and sound, and body and self. In this class we will depart from traditional theater to study significant performances of the last 100 years, and what their creators and critics said about them. Cross-listed with ENG 259."

The Philharmonic, the Opera, the Parliament, the Film Studio served different purposes during Imperial, Nazi, Divided, and Unified Berlin and reflect Germany\u2019s changing values in the arts, culture, and politics. What role did classical music play under different regimes? What does a building\u2019s design teach us about its builders\u2019 mission? This course also offers the option of a two-week study abroad component during the last two weeks of May. We will travel to Berlin and Freiburg to visit the sites we studied and engage in further historical exploration on location. We will conclude the trip with a week -long visit at our partner conservatory, the Musikhochschule Freiburg for an immersive experience in German musical training."

Can literature give us insights into politics that political manifestos, treatises, and commentaries cannot? Inversely, how does politics or persecution influence the production, distribution, and circulation of literary works? We will investigate the underlying themes and metaphors of novels, short stories, poetry, and cinema from across Asia, Africa, and the Middle East that reflect on these questions while at the same time we will frame our discussions by key texts from a variety of humanistic and social science disciplines. Larger questions of global peace, freedom of expression, human rights, solidarity, and activism in post-9/11 era will be inseparable from our discussions of globalization, empire, modernity, and nationalism."

An emphasis on versatility, creativity and innovation has become integral to discussions about the future of music and the arts, but our understanding of these concepts remains elusive.  Music is an interdisciplinary endeavor, and the goal of this course is to explore how diverse academic disciplines and cultural perspectives can help us better understand the ecology of creativity. Working collaboratively toward this goal, students will research an aspect of their musicianship in depth as they explore and apply ideas about creativity to music, and develop a framework for evaluating the many different approaches to this topic.  This course is useful for advanced non-native speakers of English, as well as students interested in developing professional skills in an intercultural environment."

Overviews of the cultural landscape will contextualize the activity of composers and musicians under investigation. Areas of emphasis include the development of vocal genres (motet, Mass, chanson, madrigal), as well as distinctive types of instrumental music. Basic theoretical underpinnings such as mode, hexachord, and notational conventions are covered. There will be some attention to reading period notation and engagement with digital advancements and tools in the study of Renaissance music."

Topics of inquiry will include performance practices, organ instruments and continuo techniques, conflicting theological and social ideas of Baroque and Enlightenment Catholicism, reforms associated with Josephinist Vienna and regional civic/religious structures, and the \u201cdramatizing\u201d of theological principles in liturgical music using Classical compositional conventions. Students participate in class discussions of the works and topics and develop research projects regarding the intersection of scholarship and performance, resulting in a formal presentation and paper, with the possibility of including a performance activity in the project."

      "description": "Romanticism and Improvisation: This course explores how European critics, musicians, and authors understood improvisation throughout the long nineteenth century. Many of the important shifts in musical culture during this period\u2014including the emergence of the work concept and the increasing importance of the score as object of reverence\u2014have been invoked to explain improvisation\u2019s decline or marginalization by the turn of the twentieth century. We will critically evaluate such broad changes, asking whether they truly did act to suppress improvisation and if so, how. Focusing on improvisation in poetry, opera, and keyboard performance, as well as critical reception of virtuosi and improvisers, we will move beyond the musical scene and seek to trace improvisation\u2019s importance in wider cultural contexts."

Over the last thirty years or so, both performers and scholars have increasingly engaged them. In this seminar, we will consider Handel\u2019s operas and cantatas from multiple perspectives, highlighting especially their status as literary, musical, and cultural practices. We will also consider the relevant performance techniques of the era. This approach should help us both to comprehend how these works communicated to their original audiences and to suggest ways they might continue to communicate today. A final research project, presented to the seminar, will be required."

Coming to the understanding that a recording is often a performance in itself, and not necessarily a mere document of a live performance, will be an issue, but more importantly: what music is in the recording? What in the recorded performance is there because of, despite, or unrelated to (and therefore \u201cfree\u201d of) the technology employed? How should we listen to musical performances that not only differ in performance style but acoustical aesthetic\u2014and how should we monitor our response?"

Although we will not attempt a comprehensive survey of recent art music, we will explore a variety of compositions, both U.S. and international. We will also consider the roles that aesthetics, economics, politics, and technology play in shaping new music. And, as part of our work together in this course, we will develop strategies for researching, understanding, and writing about the recent past and present day. Assignments will include weekly reading, listening, and score study; small writing assignments and/or brief oral presentations; and final research paper/presentation. "

Rather than taking our bearings solely from musical works, we will consider how nineteenth-century music criticism illuminates how people listened to music and what they listened for.  Readings will illustrate the broad spectrum of aesthetic, moral, and historical concerns that made up the Romantic movement.  Among our aims will be to understand how Romantic notions of nature, subjectivity, meaning, and nationhood were thought to resonate in music.  Figures for discussion include Wackenroder, Hoffmann, Hegel, Beethoven, Schumann, Berlioz, Wagner, and others.

The focus of this course is on very early-stage ideas when information is greatly lacking and time and money to research answers are also limited. Students, in group format, will first build their own idea filtering system. Then they will generate and filter their own ideas and evaluate them based upon technical merit, business challenges, and early market indicators. Finally, students will present their analysis to an outside panel. Behind this evaluation process, the class will review reference material on the business process of managing the concept stage of innovation."

In-depth examination of both individual scenes and complete operas will give students a firm grounding in verbal and musical forms, text/music relationships, and the expressive power of operatic conventions. Our exploration will include consideration of staging, reception, and how practices such as revision, self-borrowing, and the influence of particular singers all contribute to the well-known fluidity of operatic works."

With black gospel music as the central focal point, we will examine the ways in which gospel music and black church traditions have been in conversation with various secular forms of music. We will unpack how the sacred and secular realms have influenced one another and the extent to which various vocal and stylistic techniques have transcended the categorical confinements of individual genres. For example, we will look at the influence of the black church and gospel vocal technique on soul music (and even funk music) in order to understand why gospel vocal technique has been effective in popular music. We will also consider how gospel artists adjust their voices/peformances to have secular appeal, and how secular artists adjust their voices/performances to invoke the sacred."

These struggles largely revolved around some fundamental questions: Who is God? Who is Jesus Christ? What is scripture? What is Christianity? Who is Christian? How are Christians to act? While these questions were provisionally addressed in the earliest Christian writings, they were not resolved authoritatively until the 4th-6th centuries, when church leaders repeatedly gathered at councils to fix official church doctrine on various controversial issues (e.g. Jesus Christ, scripture, the Trinity, and original sin). This class will survey how, from the beginning (but especially after the 4th century), Christians tried to answer these questions in various ways (through theology, dialogue, debate, censure, excommunication, episcopal influence, and others) and thereby determined the subsequent course of Christianity."

Assignments include weekly readings and sound/video/web examples, short response papers, and a final research paper and presentation. Background in either music, visual, or literary studies is necessary."

Topics include randomization tests, bootstrapping, nonparametric tests, ANOVA models (fixed, random and mixed models, crossed and nested), multiple comparisons and linear contrasts, multiple linear regression, binary logistic regression and related topics. The course uses examples and case studies from both the natural and social sciences. The use of computer programs is emphasized for calculations and there is a strong emphasis on assumptions, models and interpretation of results."

In this course, students are introduced to the methods and objectives of decision analysis and cost-effectiveness research, as well as to important study design issues that distinguish these investigations from other clinical research studies. Students will also learn decision analysis software such that they can perform analyses themselves as a class project. The course will be taught in an online hybrid format consisting of a weekly 1.5 hour classroom session supplemented by online learning and practice activities using Blackboard."

      "description": "In medical ecology, human beings as biological and social entities are placed within a wider context of dynamic ecosystems that incorporate physical, biological, and sociocultural components. Worldwide there is a resurgent interest in medical ecology to offer analytic paradigms to study, track, and address both new and old risks to human health, taking into account micro- and macro-environmental conditions and processes. Medical ecology is particularly concerned with applying a systems approach to analyzing disease, with an emphasis on how change in environments relates to change in risk of exposure and incidence of disease. Many methods are used to generate and test medical ecological models, drawn from medical geography, epidemiology, biology, and the social sciences. Many of the lessons from this course come from global health, health impact of colonial relationships, and diseases of lifestyle and modernization."
